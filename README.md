# Modern JavaScript and REST

This workshop focuses on the new language constructs in the latest version of JavaScript known as ECMAScript2015 or ECAMScript 6. We'll look at what problems these things solve, and also build something against a server-side REST based API. 

This workshop also covers more of working with web development in a browser development console and inspecting web traffic with Fiddler or Postman (chrome plugin).

This repository contains a link to a Google Presentation and three exercises.
